sentence=Easy to use Over The Air Code Uploading and OTATerminal for the ESP8266 and ESP32.
paragraph=This library allows you to easily upload code to the ESP8266 or ESP32 over the air, as well as communicate with it on a terminal over an HTTP port. The Code Uploading is designed to be used with the Arduino IDE built-in OTACodeUploader feature. Make sure you have the esp8266 board package installed if using the ESP8266, or the esp32 board package installed if using the ESP32. When using the library, the board will open a WiFi access point.
